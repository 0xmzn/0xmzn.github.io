            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>
                Life is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l482T0yNkeo">0x68656C6C</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I listen to a lot of music and I enjoy cooking. I also make 9/10 Turkish Coffee. I used to geek about linux a lot
                but I stopped doing that recently. Don't get me started tho. 
            </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>STEM Highschool</h3>
            <p>
                The glorious, best highschool to exist in Egypt, <a href="https://www.stemegypt.net/">STEM Highschool for Boys</a>.
                A place where barbarian, ill-mannered, surprisingly academically excellent 150 teenage
                come together to live in a boarding school for three years. This might sound like a recipe for disaster but I kid you not,
                these kids will develop and excel in their life after highschool (well, not all of them. Some suffer from severe depression
                but that a small percentage).
            </p>
            <p>
                I, myself, love this place more than any educational institution I have ever stepped a foot into.
                I am not saying it's all roses but, for me at least, the pros outweigh the cons.
            </p>
            <h3>Ain Shams University</h3>
            <p>
                I started my Computer Science journey in that place. IT WAS SHIT! Everything about it is shitty. From the University itself who thought
                it would be a good idea to demolish the green landscape in the campus and replace it with chairs and asphalt so that we can enjoy
                our time in the sunny days of July to the Student affairs who refused to let me drop out because "I was not old enough" as they said.
                I was 21 BTW. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't recommend that place to anyone.
            </p>
            <h3>Budapest University of Technology and Economics</h3>
            <p>
                Lehetne jobb is. Nem j√≥. Some professors are racist to international students but I skip most of the class so idgaf. I am a second year student
                studying BSc in Computer Science Engineering.
